# Predicting Employee Attrition

*By now everyone has seen some headline about the 'Great Resignation' - the significantly high employee attrition rates following the COVID-19 pandemic.  While the name may imply that the phenomenon is new and temporary, it is actually a continuation of a decade-long trend of increasing voluntary attrition (https://hbr.org/2022/03/the-great-resignation-didnt-start-with-the-pandemic).  Thus, HR teams will need to continue to contend with rising turnover among the myriad of other issues they are facing such as the rise of remote/hybrid work arrangements and the corresponding heightened fluidity in the talent market.

*Companies are building and expanding their People Analytics teams to apply data science and advanced analytics to help meet these challenges.  In this project, I have used a public HR dataset containing anonymized information about ~1,500 employees at a company to develop a statistical model to predict employee attrition (https://data.world/aaizemberg/hr-employee-attrition).  The information includes fields such as role, department, educational background, compensation, demographic information, internal and external work history, responses to employee surveys (about, for example, engagement, work-life balance, etc.) and, of course, whether that employee voluntarily left.

## The Data

The table below shows the fields available in the dataset, separated by category. The target feature is a binary label called Attrition.
