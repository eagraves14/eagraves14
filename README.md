I am a data scientist/analyst focused primarily on people analytics with additional interest in the leisure/entertainment space. Previously, I was an executive compensation consultant with FW Cook. This repository contains my work in the Data Science Career Track at Springboard including two Capstone projects.

My first capstone project can be found under eagraves14/Capstone2. This project consists of a logistic regression model that predicts voluntary employee attrition with 75% precision based on a real-world dataset.

My second capstone project can be found at the Tableau Public link below, with a short discussion document also included under eagraves14/Capstone3. This project consists of a Tableau workbook that analyzes the popularity of games on the Steam platform across dimensions such as genre, release date, and pricing. The discussion document explains some of the trends shown in the workbook in addition to providing background information about the data source, pre-processing/transformations, etc.
