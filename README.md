I am an ex-consultant pivoting into data science and advanced analytics. This repository contains my work in the Data Science Career Track at Springboard including two Capstone projects.

My first capstone project can be found under eagraves14/Capstone2. This project consists of a logistic regression model that predicts voluntary employee attrition with 75% precision based on a real-world dataset.
